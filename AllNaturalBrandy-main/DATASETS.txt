Insights we hope to gain from two chosen datasets
*************************************************

We are curious if there are patterns to be found between Hollywood and its (culturally distinct) cousin Bollywood. Is
there a trend in the types of genres released that is the same or different between the two? Does one output
significantly more movies? Surprising similarities or marked disparities could provide insight to the culture
surrounding the movie industry.



Impossible Joins:
Join was not possible due to incompatible data types INT and STRING.
To make the initial construction of the tables, we had to explicitly type some variables as strings 
that would normally be integers. Therefore, to make the join possible, these changed variables - namely startYear 
in the hollywood dataset - must be correctly typed as an integer.
